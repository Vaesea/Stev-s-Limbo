## Stev's Limbo Credits
Purgateam / Bambi's Purgatory Team (Bambi's Purgatory (stev's limbo is very inspired by bambi's purgatory))

Your Average FNF Pro (Made VS Stev and all the stuff from VS Stev that's used in this mod)

Maevings (Opposition. Hostility is VERY inspired by Opposition, it accidentally copies like 2 of the patterns, oops. That will be changed next demo! Also to be clear, Opposition is NOT used in this mod because this isn't VS Stev Definitive Edition (no hate to vsde))

The reason why Gamebanana and GitHub links have spaces in them is because I'm scared about accidentally giving a notification to someone

## Scrapped Songs and Song Ideas
- [x] No Limit (Hellish Hostilev) (Scrapped because the vocals of it were terrible and it no longer makes sense to be in the mod) (Made by Vaesea and Convival (convival9 on youtube))
- [x] Corny (Bambi) (Scrapped because I just didn't want to chart it) (Made by Vaesea)
- [x] Gone (Nightmare Hostilev) (Scrapped because it was stupid. The song was pretty good but the lyrics part was weird) (Made by Vaesea)


## Extra Info
You can help with this if you want, I'll upload stuff such as effects for characters and voices for characters soon but if you want those now just ask me in issues or on Discord.
My discord account is vaesea.

Don't put stuff in assets unless absolutely necessary (for example, a new type of note should go in assets, but a new song should go in mods)
